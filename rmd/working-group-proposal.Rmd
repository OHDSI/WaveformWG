# **Working Group Proposal**

<br>

## **Overview**

This page summarizes the formal proposal to launch the OHDSI Waveform Working Group. The complete proposal document is available in the Resources section of this repository.

<br>

## **Mission Statement**

To enable integration of physiological waveform data (e.g., ECG, EEG, arterial blood pressure) with electronic health records in the OMOP Common Data Model, supporting observational research, AI model development, and clinical decision support.

<br>

## **Background & Motivation**

### **The Challenge**

Physiological waveform data represents a rich source of information about patient health status, yet this data remains largely siloed from electronic health records used in observational research. Current challenges include:

- **Format Heterogeneity**: Dozens of proprietary and open formats make data sharing difficult
- **Temporal Misalignment**: Synchronizing continuous waveform data with discrete clinical events
- **Metadata Loss**: Signal characteristics often not preserved during data transfers
- **Limited Integration**: Waveform data typically stored separately from EHR systems
- **Reproducibility Gaps**: Lack of standardized feature definitions across institutions

### **The Opportunity**

The OMOP Common Data Model has successfully standardized clinical data across hundreds of institutions worldwide. Extending OMOP to include physiological waveforms would enable:

- **Multi-Site Studies**: Federated research using harmonized waveform representations
- **Integrated Analytics**: Seamless analysis combining waveforms with diagnoses, medications, procedures, and outcomes
- **AI/ML Development**: Training and validation of predictive models across institutions
- **Reproducible Science**: Standardized feature definitions enable cross-institution validation

<br>

## **Proposed Scope**

### **In Scope**

The working group will focus on:

1. **Schema Development**
   - Define OMOP CDM extensions for waveform data
   - Specify table schemas, relationships, and constraints
   - Ensure compatibility with core OMOP principles

2. **Vocabulary Development**
   - Develop concepts for waveform types (ECG, EEG, ABP, etc.)
   - Map signal channels and derived features
   - Coordinate with OMOP vocabulary team

3. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Create ETL specifications and best practices
   - Develop reference implementations for common formats
   - Provide data quality and validation frameworks

4. **Tool Development**
   - Build ETL utilities and converters
   - Create visualization and analysis tools
   - Integrate with OHDSI HADES packages

5. **Community Support**
   - Support institutions implementing the extension
   - Facilitate use case development
   - Enable multi-site collaborative studies

### **Out of Scope**

The working group will NOT:

- Develop new waveform file formats
- Provide clinical interpretation services
- Maintain proprietary device integrations
- Offer individualized consulting services

## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Risk: Low Adoption**

**Mitigation**:
- Focus on high-impact use cases (ICU, cardiology)
- Provide comprehensive implementation support
- Demonstrate value through multi-site studies
- Build easy-to-use tools and templates

### **Risk: Technical Complexity**

**Mitigation**:
- Develop reference implementations
- Provide step-by-step guides and video tutorials
- Offer office hours and implementation support
- Start simple and iterate based on feedback

### **Risk: Vocabulary Challenges**

**Mitigation**:
- Engage OMOP vocabulary team early
- Leverage existing standards (LOINC, SNOMED)
- Use 2-billion concept range for waveform-specific terms
- Plan for gradual vocabulary maturation

### **Risk: Data Privacy Concerns**

**Mitigation**:

- Support aggregated feature sharing (not raw waveforms)
- Align with OHDSI's existing privacy frameworks
- Develop privacy-preserving analysis methods

## **Alignment with OHDSI Strategy**

The Waveform Working Group aligns with OHDSI's strategic priorities:

### **1. Expand Data Coverage**

Waveform data complements existing OMOP tables, enabling more comprehensive observational research.
